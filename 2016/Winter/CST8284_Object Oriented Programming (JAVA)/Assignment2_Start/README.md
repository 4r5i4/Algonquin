### Description:
A [JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm#JFXST784) browser application
  - Main class: 
    - MyGUI.java
  - features: 
    - Home, back, forward buttons with icons
    - Bookmark button
    - Animated history window
    - File menu can open a new window session that has its own control elements
    - Clicking on the bookmark will load that url
    - Homepage is the almighty www.google.com
    - Encorporated .css
    
### Things I didn't get right:
  - How to put the url in the url box as the user is navigating through different pages
  - How to put disable bookmark duplicates in the bookmark menu

### Things I didn't have time to do:
  -[] allow user to change homepage
  -[] allow user to save history 
  -[] allow user to open tabs
  -[] allow keyboard shortcuts e.g. CTRL+c, CTRL+L

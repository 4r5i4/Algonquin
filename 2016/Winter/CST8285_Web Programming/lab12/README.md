# Description:
###### Beginner level website written in HTML, PHP, and combination of both
  - features: 
    - Has navigation to other pages 
    - Includes login for admins
    - Includes Newsletter Contact form inserted into the InitializeDatabase.sql database
    - Incorporates password_hash() to encrypt user email
    - Uses object oriented PHP concepts to create and modify objects
    
## Things I didn't get right:
  - [ ] How to resize the window after showing a long string of hashed emails in the 'List' page

  - [ ] allow user to change view from hashed emails to original email string representation
